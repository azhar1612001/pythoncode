1)In first line, openening the file in read mode and assumed file name is file.txt
2)Reading the file line by line and I declare a list which is set of words that indicates racial slurs and variable name is racialslurs.
3)I take a variable sen that specify sentence number
4)Since each line will contain may words so, i split the line across space and put into list
5)I traverse on the list and check that word is a part of racialslurs or not if yes then i increase the value of count by 1 (to count number of words of racialslurs contained by that line).
6)After that I calculate the profanity for each sentence and increase the value of sen variable.
7)Iteratively profaniy will be calculated for each sentence.
